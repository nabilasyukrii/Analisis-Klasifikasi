## 📂 Project List

This repository contains distinct projects demonstrating different statistical methods:

### 1. [Unsupervised] K-Means Clustering
* **Goal:** Segmenting data based on similarities to identify patterns without predefined labels.
* **Method:** K-Means Algorithm, Elbow Method for optimal $k$.
* **Key Insight:** Successfully grouped data into 3 distinct clusters based on behavioral characteristics.
* **📂 [Go to Project Folder](./01_Customer_Segmentation_KMeans)**

### 2. [Supervised] Logistic Regression Classification
* **Goal:** Predicting categorical outcomes (Binary Classification) based on independent variables.
* **Method:** Binary Logistic Regression, Odds Ratio interpretation.
* **Key Insight:** Identified key variables that significantly influence the probability of the outcome.
* **📂 [Go to Project Folder](./02_Churn_Prediction_Logistic)**
